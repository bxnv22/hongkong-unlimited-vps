# Hong Kong Unlimited Traffic VPS: Your Guide to Fast, Stable Unmetered Servers

Looking for a VPS that won't leave you sweating over traffic limits? If you've been burned by bandwidth caps before, or if you're running something that just eats through data, you're in the right place. Let's talk about unlimited traffic VPS servers in Hong Kong—what they actually mean, who needs them, and which providers won't let you down.

## Why Unlimited Traffic Actually Matters

A while back, I recommended some high-bandwidth Hong Kong VPS options. But honestly? For certain use cases, bandwidth alone isn't enough. You need truly unlimited traffic.

Think about it. You're running a video site, an image hosting service, or maybe some data collection operation. Your monthly traffic consumption? Totally unpredictable. With a regular VPS, you're either getting shut down when you hit the cap, or you're staring at a terrifying overage bill.

The providers I'm covering here offer legitimate unlimited traffic options. Whether you're building websites, running international marketing operations, or handling any high-traffic workload, there's something here that'll fit.

### The Traffic Anxiety Is Real

Anyone who's used a metered VPS knows the feeling. You're constantly watching that dashboard, praying you don't go over. Your site traffic ticks up a bit, and suddenly you're doing mental math about whether you'll make it to the end of the month. Those last few days? You're compressing images, limiting access, maybe even taking the site down until the counter resets.

It sucks.

Unlimited traffic means you stop thinking about it. No monitoring. No calculating costs. No panic when traffic spikes. Your site runs however it needs to run, your business scales however it needs to scale. Zero psychological overhead.

### When You Really Need Unlimited

Based on years of running different services, here's where unlimited traffic stops being nice-to-have and becomes essential:

**Video sites and image hosting**: This is the big one. A single 1080P video file can be several hundred megabytes. Users watch it a few times, and metered VPS just can't handle it.

**APIs and data services**: If you're providing API endpoints for others to call, traffic consumption gets scary fast. Individual requests might be small, but the volume adds up brutally.

**International e-commerce and cross-border sites**: Foreign trade sites are packed with images. High-res product photos, video demonstrations—the traffic disappears quickly.

**Download sites and resource sharing**: Download sites are traffic killers by nature. Even if you're just hosting software and documents, enough download attempts and you're done.

### Why Hong Kong Though?

Hong Kong's advantage is location. Latency to mainland China typically sits between 10-50ms—way faster than US or European servers. Plus, Hong Kong is an international network hub with solid international bandwidth, so accessing overseas resources is fast too.

Your site can serve mainland users and international users equally well. And here's the kicker: **Hong Kong VPS doesn't require ICP filing**. You buy it, you use it. No bureaucratic headaches.

Combine unlimited traffic with Hong Kong's location, and you've got the ideal setup: fast speeds, low latency, no traffic caps, no filing requirements. For businesses needing high traffic and high bandwidth, this is pretty much the optimal choice.

## The Recommended Providers

Providers offering genuine Hong Kong unlimited traffic VPS aren't actually that common. I've spent considerable time testing and comparing, and these are the ones worth your attention.

### 1. JustVPS - Best Value Option

JustVPS focuses specifically on unlimited traffic VPS services. They're relatively new but have built a solid reputation in the Hong Kong market. Their standout feature is **truly unlimited traffic** at very reasonable prices—perfect if you're budget-conscious but traffic-hungry.

Their plans are straightforward: Standard, Medium, and Premium. I've been using the Medium plan myself, consuming over 5TB monthly, and **I've never been throttled**. The only caveat is that Hong Kong nodes can slow down a bit during evening peak hours, but overall it's quite stable.

**Key specs:**
- Bandwidth: 300Mbps - 1Gbps shared
- Storage: NVMe SSD
- RAM: Starting from 2GB
- Price: Very competitive for unlimited traffic

### 2. DMIT - Quasi-Unlimited Approach

DMIT is an established name in the Hong Kong VPS market, known for line quality. They don't offer strict unlimited traffic, but their T1 series has a clever design: **when you exhaust your traffic allocation, they don't cut you off—they throttle to 50Mbps+ and let you keep running**.

For many users, this is actually more practical than pure unlimited.



DMIT's approach is smart. The monthly traffic allocation is generous enough for most users. If you somehow exceed it, you still maintain 100Mbps speed, which barely affects normal operations. For instance, the STARTER plan includes 4TB monthly—plenty for typical websites.

When you're dealing with unpredictable traffic patterns, having a provider that won't just shut you down makes all the difference. The performance stays consistent even during mainland China's peak hours, which is exactly what you need for serving audiences across different time zones.

### 3. DIYVM - Domestic Provider Choice

DIYVM is a veteran Chinese provider specializing in CN2 line VPS. Their Hong Kong products **use CN2 GIA lines across the board**, offer unlimited traffic, and support Alipay—very friendly for domestic users.

DIYVM's plans feature modest bandwidth but unlimited traffic with **CN2 GIA direct connection**. While 5Mbps or 10Mbps might seem low, the premium line quality and dedicated allocation mean actual performance is excellent. If your business primarily targets domestic users and needs stable return-to-China routing, DIYVM is a solid choice.

**Standout features:**
- Full CN2 GIA routing
- Unlimited traffic on all plans
- Native Chinese support and payment methods
- Dedicated bandwidth (not shared)

### 4. JustHost - Russian Veteran

JustHost is a Russian VPS provider with nodes across multiple Asian locations. Their Hong Kong VPS offers **reasonable pricing, unlimited traffic, and support for multiple operating systems**—suitable for users needing stable service.

JustHost costs slightly more than JustVPS, but **stability and service quality are noticeably better**. They name their plans after constellations, which is kind of fun. They also support Windows systems, which is valuable if you need to run Windows applications.

**Notable points:**
- Supports both Linux and Windows
- Established provider with years of operation
- Good balance of price and performance
- Multiple payment options

### 5. RAKsmart - Customization Specialist

RAKsmart is a US-based provider with data centers in Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States. Their defining feature is **highly customizable configurations—you can freely select bandwidth size and line type**, with relatively transparent pricing.

Plans are divided into Compute, General Purpose, and Memory categories. The General Purpose plans are what I'd recommend here. Their specialty is **self-configurable bandwidth starting from 1Mbps**—if you need more, just pay to upgrade. Multiple line options too: mainland-optimized routes, CN2 lines, each priced differently.

**Why consider RAKsmart:**
- Complete configuration flexibility
- Transparent pricing model
- Multiple line quality options
- Suitable for specific performance requirements

### 6. ZLIDC - High-Bandwidth CN2 Solution

ZLIDC specializes in CN2 lines. Their Hong Kong VPS **uses CN2 direct connection throughout and provides native IPs**—particularly suitable for users needing to bypass regional restrictions.

**Why ZLIDC:**
- CN2 GIA direct connection: Fast return-to-China speeds, low latency, stable during peak hours
- Native Hong Kong IP: Can unlock Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming services
- High bandwidth configuration: Starting from 3Mbps, up to 10Mbps
- Test IP available: Can test latency and speed before purchase

ZLIDC pricing is on the higher end for CN2 providers. **Bandwidth isn't massive, but line quality is consistently stable**. They provide test IP `185.213.61.16`—definitely test before buying because ZLIDC's Hong Kong cloud servers **don't support testing periods or refunds**.

Worth noting: they also offer shared bandwidth plans—500Mbps shared with 5TB+ monthly traffic. If your traffic is predictable, these plans offer better value.

## What to Watch Out For

Seen the recommendations and feeling tempted? Hold up. **The Hong Kong unlimited traffic VPS market has some murky waters**. Plenty of providers play word games—claiming unlimited traffic on the surface while imposing various restrictions in practice.

### Two Types of "Unlimited Traffic"

First, understand that **unlimited traffic comes in two flavors, and they're very different**.

**Type 1: Dedicated Bandwidth + Unlimited Traffic**

This is the ideal scenario. They give you 5Mbps or 10Mbps dedicated bandwidth, then don't limit traffic. Under this model, you can **run at full speed 24/7, transfer as much as you want**. The advantage is stability and predictability—you know exactly what your bandwidth ceiling is. Providers like DIYVM and ZLIDC use this model.

**Type 2: Shared Large Bandwidth + Fair Usage Policy**

This approach gives you huge bandwidth numbers—300Mbps, 1Gbps—with unlimited traffic. **But there's a catch: you can't sustain full bandwidth usage long-term**. Providers typically have a Fair Usage Policy stipulating you can't run sustained high loads.

For example, they give you 1Gbps bandwidth. Theoretically, you could transfer 328TB monthly. But the provider might specify: continuous bandwidth usage exceeding 70% for 24 hours will result in throttling or warnings. JustVPS and JustHost operate this way. Always check the TOS (Terms of Service) to understand specific usage restrictions.

### How to Tell Which Type

The most direct method is **checking bandwidth allocation and pricing**. Generally:

- Bandwidth under 10Mbps, priced at a few to a dozen dollars—likely dedicated bandwidth model
- Bandwidth over 100Mbps, yet very cheap—probably shared bandwidth + fair usage policy

When unsure, **ask customer service directly before buying**: Does this unlimited traffic have restrictions? Can I run at full speed 24/7? Most providers will answer honestly. If they're evasive, be extra cautious.

### What Happens After Traffic Exhaustion

Some providers, while not offering true unlimited traffic, **handle traffic exhaustion in user-friendly ways**—worth paying attention to. **DMIT's model is worth noting**: they give you several TB monthly traffic; when exhausted, instead of cutting you off, they throttle to 50-100Mbps. Your service doesn't interrupt—it's slower but functional, much better than complete disconnection.

Other providers might **completely disconnect or charge overage fees** when traffic runs out. Overage charging is manageable, but complete disconnection means your site waits until next month to recover—potentially catastrophic losses.

### Storage Type and Capacity

Unlimited traffic typically means storing and transferring large data volumes, so **storage type and capacity are critical**.

**NVMe SSD > SATA SSD > HDD**

NVMe is fastest, suitable for databases and high-concurrency applications. SATA SSD is next but still adequate. HDD mechanical drives are slow, only suitable for infrequently accessed data. Most recommended providers use NVMe or SATA SSD.

While RAKsmart offers some HDD-based plans, if you need high performance, you can pay to upgrade to SSD.

### Refund Policies

Hong Kong VPS doesn't commonly offer refunds like US VPS providers, so **definitely check refund policies before purchasing**. Some providers offer **7-day money-back guarantees**, but with conditions—like no refund if traffic exceeds certain thresholds. Always clarify beforehand.

**Some providers don't offer refunds at all**—ZLIDC explicitly states no refunds. In such cases, consider buying the cheapest plan first as a trial, then upgrade to higher configurations once satisfied.

## Final Thoughts

After all that: **Hong Kong unlimited traffic VPS is genuinely useful, but you need to be careful when shopping**.

- Tight budget? JustVPS and JustHost offer the best value
- Need CN2 direct connection? DIYVM and ZLIDC are more appropriate
- Want enterprise-grade stability? DMIT and RAKsmart won't disappoint

Before buying, figure out whether it's dedicated or shared bandwidth, test the IP's latency and speed, check refund policies. Most importantly, choose rationally based on your actual business needs. Get the right VPS, and your site and operations will run smoothly and reliably.

## Common Questions

**Q: Is Hong Kong unlimited traffic VPS truly unlimited?**

**Genuine unlimited traffic exists**, but comes with corresponding restrictions. For instance, JustVPS and JustHost give you fixed bandwidth (like 300Mbps), but have conditions—such as Fair Usage Policies that don't allow 24/7 full-speed operation, or prohibit P2P usage.

**Q: Which is better—dedicated or shared bandwidth?**

**There's no absolute answer; it depends on your use case.**

Dedicated bandwidth, while numerically modest (5Mbps, 10Mbps), lets you run full speed 24/7—suitable for scenarios requiring **stable continuous transmission**. Shared bandwidth offers large numbers (like 1Gbps) but can't sustain full capacity long-term—suitable for **burst traffic** scenarios, like websites with peak and off-peak periods where traffic is normally light with occasional spikes.

**Q: Is CN2 routing significantly different from regular lines?**

**The difference is huge, especially during evening peak hours**. CN2 is China Telecom's premium network, characterized by direct connection without routing detours, low latency, fast speeds, and **stability during peak hours**—unlike regular lines that suffer severe speed degradation.

**If your site primarily serves mainland audiences**, strongly consider CN2 routing. While pricier, the user experience improvement is dramatic. If mainly serving overseas users, regular international lines suffice.
